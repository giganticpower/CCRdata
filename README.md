End-to-end Shipping Container Code Spotting Based on Visual Sensors for Intelligent Inspection

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end text spotting framework for spotting multi-directional, including horizontal, vertical, and multi-line (HVM) codes.

The dataset is released, which is collected by us and has been labeled.

Thanks, authors.
